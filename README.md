WIP - Minecraft mod

An endgame mod that allows you to create anything you want using complex computer systems with special algorithms.
This mod will add a big multiblock structure that is similar to real-life supercomputer halls. This multiblock structure will have to be on the right temperature - no overheating, no fires and it'll also eat a whole lot of energy.
